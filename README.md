# todo-canvas
Creates a todo list for canvas that will integrate with Mac Windows and Linux desktops

#Items to accomplish:
* Do a better job at getting and saving the calendar data for the user
* Create a script that will download the needed libraries for the user:
   - icalendar
* Create basic text-based version that will display what is due:
   - sort assignments by due date and display one week at a time, starting 
      with current week
   - let user go through calendar one week at a time
   - let user check if assignment is done or not (make an ignore list?)
   - let user add their own todo items (making sure to handle it not having a       URL to canvas)
* Add graphics
   - Add feature that will create a line graph of the week that will reach          different points depending on how many assignments there are
   - Add optional notifications to both specific assignments, and assignments       as a whole
